# Weighing the advantages of FTC only vs. having both FTC + FRC teams

## All the same Technical Skills are important in both FTC + FRC:

 FTC | FRC | Skill
-----|-----|------
 YES | YES | Reseach & prototyping 
 YES | YES | Onshape CAD 
 YES | YES | Basic Electrical 
 YES | YES | Java Programming 
 YES | YES | Pose estimation for autonomous 
 YES | YES | Use Camera to read April Tags, process distance and azimuth for shooting 
 YES | YES | Use Git to maintain team repository 

## What are the differences?

 FTC | FRC | Aspect
-----|-----|-------
5 months, more relaxed | 2-1/2 months, more intense | Season duration, intensity
<ul><li>Scrimmage</li><li>Meet #1</li> <li>Meet #2</li><li>Meet #3</li><li>Regional Tournament</li></ul> | <ul><li>Regional Tournament</li></ul> | meets / tournaments

Small hand tools | Requires the use of large, more dangerous power tools in the shed | Safety
Cheap |  <ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Over $6000 just for tournament registration</li><li>more expensive Robot parts</li><li>higher cost for tools</li><li>Clubhouse space</li></ul> | Cost
Eobotics skills not requred. On the job training is expected. | Students need to already have advanced skills in robotics | Required skills for student participation

## I propose that we pull the plug on FRC and replace it with an Extended FTC season.
* Comparativley, FRC offers **no advantages** w/r/t FTC, only **disadvantages**.
* Having **Both** goes beyond senseless.
* Having an **Extended FTC season** offers even more advantages.
    * After the tournament, rather than ending the season, students can iterate further on their designs
        * They have already learned the competition rules
        * They still have their playing field
        * They can do re-designs
            * make evolutionary changes to their current design or
            * research a revolutionary new approach
    * Compared with having both FTC and FRC, having an extended FTC season is:
        * Cheaper
        * More efficient organizationally
        * Less hectic (no overlap)
        * Easier to accomplish training / apprenticeship of younger students
        * Better sustainability of the club

## Additional thoughts:

#### We can provide a better learning environment for our students.
* Consider the last two year's FRC robots as examples of the learning opportunity lost by **not** using the post-season to evaluate ways of improving the design.
    * *Scrappy*
        * Just by virtue of the name conferred on this robot, I think the team agreed that it had a long way to go to earn a more lustrous name.
    * *Nautilus* 
        * This robot was the combination of 2 kits bolted together, with complete CAD models of each furnished by the suppliers.
            1. AndyMark chassis
            2. ThriftyBot Elevator
        * The creative challenge confronting the team was to design an *end effector* attached to the moving stage of the elevator whose function is to grab and release the big ball.
            * The performance of their design showed opportunities for improvement.
            * Evaluating this design would have presented a golden opportunity to learn and implement some important skills.
                * **CAD skills:** The importance of making a **completely detailed** CAD model
                * **Machine Design skills:** The importance of providing 2 well-separated coaxial bearings to implement a rotational degree of freedom. 
            * <span style="background-color: yellow;">Unfortunately, this never happened and we never cashed in on this teaching / learning opportunity.</span>
* A few weeks ago, I demonstrated an omni wheel bot with 3 DOF joystick control.
    * Heather expressed interest in this type of project, possibly for off-season use
    * I mentioned that there are kits available for < $100
        * But in retrospect, I realize that while DIY kits are fun and interesting to build, they don't really invite tinkering.
    * **Continuing to work on our robot** gives us a much better opportunity to target the learning of specific skills.

#### I think there is a tendency to believe that FRC robots are more sophisticated than FTC robots.
* But this is a myth, easily dispelled by doing some online research.
    * Brogan Pratt did an [interview with Team Shooting Stars FTC 23240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0t_Db5wTA&t=53s) which described some very clever design ideas. Just because it's FTC, doesn't mean it can't have sophisticated and clever design.
    * Sparkfun presented an [infomercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcCNC8wExUc&t=120s) about their Optical Tracking Odometry Sensor during which they interviewed team Up-a-Creek Robotics FTC 11260 about their robot's autonomous performance at world competitions (4 times).

#### Where does our FRC robot design stand right now?
* I looked at a calendar and discovered that we are now half way through the 10 week FRC season.
    * Google AI says: After 5 weeks of a 10-week FRC season:
        * The robot should be fully designed
        * CAD finalized
        * Major components built or in assembly
    * <span style="background-color: yellow;">Yet our CAD model is still in concept stage. As coaches, we need to recognize this and face up to it.</span>
