id="i-propose-that-we-pull-the-plug-on-frc-and-replace-it-with-an-extended-ftc-season.">I
propose that we pull the plug on FRC and replace it with an Extended FTC
season.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comparativley, FRC offers <strong>no advantages</strong> w/r/t FTC,
only <strong>disadvantages</strong>.</li>
<li>Having <strong>Both</strong> goes beyond senseless.</li>
<li>Having an <strong>Extended FTC season</strong> offers even more
advantages.
<ul>
<li>After the tournament, rather than ending the season, students can
iterate further on their designs
<ul>
<li>They have already learned the competition rules</li>
<li>They still have their playing field</li>
<li>They can do re-designs
<ul>
<li>make evolutionary changes to their current design or</li>
<li>research a revolutionary new approach</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compared with having both FTC and FRC, having an extended FTC season
is:
<ul>
<li>Cheaper</li>
<li>More efficient organizationally</li>
<li>Less hectic (no overlap)</li>
<li>Easier to accomplish training / apprenticeship of younger
students</li>
<li>Better sustainability of the club</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="additional-thoughts">Additional thoughts:</h2>
<h4
id="we-can-provide-a-better-learning-environment-for-our-students.">We
can provide a better learning environment for our students.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Consider the last two year’s FRC robots as examples of the learning
opportunity lost by <strong>not</strong> using the post-season to
evaluate ways of improving the design.
<ul>
<li><em>Scrappy</em>
<ul>
<li>Just by virtue of the name conferred on this robot, I think the team
agreed that it had a long way to go to earn a more lustrous name.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Nautilus</em>
<ul>
<li>This robot was the combination of 2 kits bolted together, with
complete CAD models of each furnished by the suppliers.
<ol type="1">
<li>AndyMark chassis</li>
<li>ThriftyBot Elevator</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The creative challenge confronting the team was to design an <em>end
effector</em> attached to the moving stage of the elevator whose
function is to grab and release the big ball.
<ul>
<li>The performance of their design showed opportunities for
improvement.</li>
<li>Evaluating this design would have presented a golden opportunity to
learn and implement some important skills.
<ul>
<li><strong>CAD skills:</strong> The importance of making a
<strong>completely detailed</strong> CAD model</li>
<li><strong>Machine Design skills:</strong> The importance of providing
2 well-separated coaxial bearings to implement a rotational degree of
freedom.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;">Unfortunately, this never
happened and we never cashed in on this teaching / learning
opportunity.</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A few weeks ago, I demonstrated an omni wheel bot with 3 DOF
joystick control.
<ul>
<li>Heather expressed interest in this type of project, possibly for
off-season use</li>
<li>I mentioned that there are kits available for &lt; $100
<ul>
<li>But in retrospect, I realize that while DIY kits are fun and
interesting to build, they don’t really invite tinkering.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Continuing to work on our robot</strong> gives us a much
better opportunity to target the learning of specific skills.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4
id="i-think-there-is-a-tendency-to-believe-that-frc-robots-are-more-sophisticated-than-ftc-robots.">I
think there is a tendency to believe that FRC robots are more
sophisticated than FTC robots.</h4>
<ul>
<li>But this is a myth, easily dispelled by doing some online research.
<ul>
<li>Brogan Pratt did an <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0t_Db5wTA&amp;t=53s">interview
with Team Shooting Stars FTC 23240</a> which described some very clever
design ideas. Just because it’s FTC, doesn’t mean it can’t have
sophisticated and clever design.</li>
<li>Sparkfun presented an <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcCNC8wExUc&amp;t=120s">infomercial</a>
about their Optical Tracking Odometry Sensor during which they
interviewed team Up-a-Creek Robotics FTC 11260 about their robot’s
autonomous performance at world competitions (4 times).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="where-does-our-frc-robot-design-stand-right-now">Where does our
FRC robot design stand right now?</h4>
<ul>
<li>I looked at a calendar and discovered that we are now half way
through the 10 week FRC season.
<ul>
<li>Google AI says: After 5 weeks of a 10-week FRC season:
<ul>
<li>The robot should be fully designed</li>
<li>CAD finalized</li>
<li>Major components built or in assembly</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span style="background-color: yellow;">Yet our CAD model is
still in concept stage. As coaches, we need to recognize this and face
up to it.</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
